# About Me

######
I've been working as a data/business analyst for the past 5 years and self-taught myself how to code in SQL and Python. After 3 years of teaching myself and building report automation scripts, I decided to further my coding skills by learning full stack development. 
######
I joined a coding bootcamp and I spent 4 months learning web development in html, css, javascript, python, java and mern. 
######
Now I strive to develop fun, creative and innovative websites and web applications. Feel free to check out my github and let me know if you have any questions.

💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on projects. I currently have been creating projects in Java and React, but I also enjoy python.
