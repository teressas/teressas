# About Me

######
👋 Hi, My name is Teressa Sung. 
🌈 🌺 I'm born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii and I'm currently living in Seattle, Washington.
I enjoy trying new food, animals 🐻🦉🦋🐶, nature and anything adventure.
I've been working as a data/business analyst for the past 5 years and self-taught myself how to code in SQL and Python. After 3 years of working on creating data analysis reports, I realized that no matter what report you create your reader's experience is most important. That led me to pursuing a full stack developer role where I strive to develop websites and web applications where I'm passionate about creating fun, creative and innovative user experience. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects.
