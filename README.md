# About Me

######
👋 Hi, My name is Teressa Sung. 
🌈 🌺 I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and I'm currently living in Seattle, Washington.
I enjoy trying new food, animals 🐻🦉🦋🐶, nature and anything adventure!
I've been working as a data/business analyst for the past 5 years and self-taught myself how to code in SQL and Python. After 3 years of teaching myself and building report automation scripts, I decided to further my coding skills by learning full stack development. I joined a coding bootcamp and I spent 4 months learning web development in html, css, javascript, python, java and mern. Now I strive to develop fun, creative and innovative websites and web applications. Feel free to check out my github and let me know if you have any questions.

💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on projects. I prefer to code in Java and JavaScript.
